# Model Railroad Time Table generating program
The Time Table  program is a port of the Time Table V2 program that is part of
the Model  Railroad  System.  That  program is partly in C++  (low-level  data
structures) and part in Tcl/Tk (GUI main program).  This is mostly just a port
of the C++ code. This  program  was  inspired by chapter 8 of the book _How to
Operate Your Model Railroad_ by Bruce A. Chubb.  I strongly  recommend reading
this chapter  fully before using this  program.  This program  implements  the
methods described in this chapter, in an automated fashion.
