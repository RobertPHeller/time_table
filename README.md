# Model Railroad Time Table generating program
The Time Table  library is a port of the Time Table V2 program that is part of
the Model  Railroad  System.  That  program is partly in C++  (low-level  data
structures) and part in Tcl/Tk (GUI main program).  This is mostly just a port
of the C++ code. This  program  was  inspired by chapter 8 of the book _How to
Operate Your Model Railroad_ by Bruce A. Chubb.  I strongly  recommend reading
this chapter  fully before using this  program.  This program  implements  the
methods described in this chapter, in an automated fashion. 

The time tables this library creates are LaTeX source.  You will need to 
install the LaTeX system to process the LaTeX source into a PDF file that 
can then be printed.
